# eryn.api-discordchecker
This script uses Eryn.io API's function to check Discord IDs for any connected Roblox Accounts through RoVer.
This script does an API Call in seconds instead of having to wait and trying to find the documentation.
The output is technically in .json but can be read out easily, like the normal .json.

Oh and, here's the API documentation cause these guys are cool.

Thought to add the Roblox ID for Discord account until I realized that function was disabled under the API.
Like, multi choice, you know
